# Solar Starfire Galaxy Generator

## Description

Solar Starfire is a pen and paper game created by Starfire Design Studio.  As part of the game there are rules for setting up the galaxy by generating star systems and the routes (warp points) that connect them.  The rules are a bit cumbersome and this project aims to automate said rules to easily and quickly generate star systems or even the entire galaxy for play.

## ToDo

~~- Finish Planet and Moon Generation with appropriate tests~~
- Add warp point generation
- Add checks for planets destroyed by warp points
- Add checks for planets destroyed by Gas Giants
- Add checks for planets destroyed/modfied due to binay, trinay star systems
- Implement system generation
- Implement Galaxy generation
- Restructure pkgs to better avoid circular dependencies and to improve ease of use
- Add a graphical interface for ease of use and display
- Collect statics of the various components created
- Containerize
